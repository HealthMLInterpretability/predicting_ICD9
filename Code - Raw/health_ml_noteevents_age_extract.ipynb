      "on an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the Medical\n",

      "oxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  A\n",

      "\n",
      "On [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel\n",
      "mask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal\n",
      "cannula at which time she was transferred to the medical\n",

      "On [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the Interventional\n",

      "stents in respiratory failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a MI.  She\n",
      "did have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\n",
      "which showed no evidence of EKG changes and negative\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Hematuria:  The patient had intermittent hematuria likely\n",
